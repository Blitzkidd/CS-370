What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists work on implementing the scientific method of hypothesis, experimentation, and analysis to each new piece of technology they work on everyday whether it's as small as some code base or entirely brand new methods and mechanics they are creating or optimizing.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I believe the best way to approach them is to figure out how to define the problems first. Doing this allows you to have a scope of the problem as well as identifying any components of the system that needs to be addressed and worked on. Once these steps are followed, determine how to flow the data, giving you much easier ways of solution to the problems anyone will have.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

This question has so many open ended solutions and issues it can bring up, having it work one way could be unethical in another way or sense, having some solutions being a double edged sword. In order to figure out some sort of balance, human input is always needed and to constantly update various things in the process. Not being mindful of various ethical responsibilities as progress towards the project is made can cause a disconnect and even distrust within even the project itself.
